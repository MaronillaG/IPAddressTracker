## Overview
my goal:  - build an application using API connection. This is my first application that uses an API, in this case 2.. 
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process
Approach: began with HTML markup and css styling then javascript for API connection.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Major learnings while working through this project: 
Key concepts: callback functions, promises, asynchronous functions, fetch().
Working with 

more CSS stylings:
  splitting the colour of a container using linear gradient.


### Continued development

Areas to continue focusing on in future projects. 

### Useful resources
